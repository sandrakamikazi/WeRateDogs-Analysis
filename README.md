# Overview

Data wrangling is gathering data, assessing its quality and structure, and cleaning it before analyzing and visualizing it. The dataset on which wrangling was
performed was the tweet archive of the Twitter user WeRateDogs, who rate peopleâ€™s dogs with humorous comments. This project was part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program at Udacity.





## Project Details
The data-wrangling process included the following steps; 
- Gathering: three different datasets were gathered by querying the Twitter API, downloading programmatically using a provided URL, and downloading manually.

- Assessing: visual and programmatic assessment of the datasets detected 8 quality and 2 tidiness issues.

- Cleaning: issues detected from the datasets under review were cleaned.
- Storing: After cleaning, the three different datasets were merged into one to make analysis easy.
- Analysis and Visualization: this was done to produce 3 insights and one visualization
- Reporting: two reports were created that described the wrangling efforts and communicated insights and visualizations obtained from the wrangled data.
